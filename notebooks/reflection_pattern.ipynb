       "Excellent implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm! Your code is clean, readable, and well-documented. Here are some suggestions and critiques to further improve your code:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Consistent naming conventions**:\n",
       "In Python, it's conventional to use underscores to separate words in function and variable names (e.g., `merge_sort` instead of `mergeSort`). You're already following this convention in most places, but there's a minor inconsistency in the `merge` function. I'd suggest renaming it to `merge_sorted_arrays` for better readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Type hints and docstring improvements**:\n",
       "You've done a great job with docstrings, but you can take it a step further by adding type hints for function parameters and return types. This makes your code more readable and self-documenting. For example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def merge_sort(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "**3. Redundant comments**:\n",
       "Some of your comments are redundant and can be removed, as they simply repeat what the code is already doing. For example, the comment `# Example usage:` can be removed, as the code is already an example of usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Minor optimization in `merge`**:\n",
       "In the `merge` function, you can use `result.extend(left or right)` instead of `result.extend(left)` and `result.extend(right)`. This takes advantage of the fact that `extend` can handle an empty list.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Consider adding a `__main__` block**:\n",
       "It's a good practice to wrap your example usage code in a `__main__` block, like this:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
       "    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n",
       "    arr = merge_sort(arr)\n",
       "    print(arr)  # [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n",
       "```\n",
       "This allows you to import your sorting module without running the example code.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Testing and edge cases**:\n",
       "While your implementation looks correct, it's essential to test it thoroughly with various input cases, including edge cases like an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with duplicate elements. You can add more test cases to ensure your implementation is robust.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, your implementation is well-structured and easy to follow. With these minor suggestions, your code will be even more polished and maintainable."

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "The `merge_sort` function takes an array as input and recursively divides it into two halves until the base case is reached (when the array has one or zero elements). The `merge` function then merges the sorted halves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `merge` function works by comparing elements from both lists and appending the smaller element to the merged list. If there are remaining elements in either list, they are appended to the merged list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the array in half with each recursive call, resulting in a logarithmic number of recursive calls. The merge step takes linear time, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log n).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Space Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm requires additional memory to store the merged list.\n",

      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " **Critiques and Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Type Hints**: While the function parameters and return types are mentioned in the docstrings, it would be better to include them directly in the function definitions to make use of Python's type hinting feature. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "def merge_sort(arr: list) -> list:\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Docstrings**: The docstrings for the functions are well-written, but it's missing information about the possible exceptions that the function might raise.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Input Validation**: The functions do not check the input values. For example, the `merge_sort` function does not check if the input is a list. It's better to add checks to ensure that the input is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Consider Using a More Pythonic Way to Check for Empty Lists**: Instead of `if len(arr) <= 1`, it's more Pythonic to check for empty lists using `if not arr` or `if arr`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Comments and Explanations**: While the explanations are given outside the functions, it's also a good practice to include comments inside the functions to make the code more understandable.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Example Usage**: Instead of using print statements for example usage, consider using a testing framework to test the function with different inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Consider Adding a Line About Stability**: Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that the order of equal elements is preserved. This is an important property of the algorithm and should be mentioned.\n",
